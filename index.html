<h2 class=" bounce" > Rail Imanzade was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku" >Baku <a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan </a> on February 11, 2017. He is the son of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/qocaq.imanzade"> Qochaq Imanzade </a> ( born 1991 ) and Shehla Imanzade ( born 1989 ). His parents are civil servants. Rail is their fisrt son and their happiness. He is 5 months old but he is trying hard to stand up and talk. He can say only two words: "Aquu" and "Vaquu". We do not know these words meanings yet but linguists in Oxford are close to discover this mystery.
