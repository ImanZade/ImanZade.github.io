For those who weren't born there, here's how you become a Swede.

Be at least 18 years old — unless you know someone.

While the age requirements are hard and fast for adult citizenship, kids are given some leeway.

Parents of kids under 12 years old can apply for their child's citizenship as long as the parent is already a Swedish citizen. Kids over 12 must sign a consent form saying they want to become a citizen.

Once a child reaches 15 years old, they have to show they've been living in Sweden for at least three consecutive years "and have conducted themselves well," according to Sweden's immigration office.

Be able to prove your identity.

A passport or similar document with an accompanying photo is fine.

Alternatively, a relative or loved one can vouch for your identity, provided they're already a Swedish citizen. According to the immigration office, for a loved one to prove your identity, the two of you must have lived together before moving to Sweden.

"You must have lived together for such a period," the requirements read, "that your spouse has knowledge of your background and life story so that your identity can be attested to without doubt."

Have a permanent residence in Sweden.

If you're planning on spending more than 90 days in Sweden — for work, studying, or starting a business — you have to submit an application for a residence permit.
