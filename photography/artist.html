  <h5>Dear Photograph,
People have asked me why I love photography and over the years I have learned that its simply because I hate change. Even when times and people and circumstances change, memories don’t. Photographs don’t. And I think that is exactly why we hang them everywhere, because for a brief moment, even in the utter chaos of life’s changes, things become normal again when we look at them; even if just for that moment. I guess I love photography because photographs never change, even when every little thing in them does. Our home is a quiet place now that my sister and I have moved away, but when I look at this photograph, I am six years old again, my family is always just a few rooms away, and I believe in everything. -Sarah
